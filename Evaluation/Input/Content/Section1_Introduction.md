Alfentanil is a potent analgesic synthetic opioid. It is fast but short-acting and used for anesthesia during surgery. Alfentanil is metabolized solely by CYP3A4 ([Phimmasone 2001](#5-References)). Like midazolam, alfentanil is not a substrate for P-gp ([Wandel 2002](#5-References)) and less than 1% of an alfentanil dose is excreted unchanged in urine ([Meuldermans 1988](#5-References)).

Although in clinical use alfentanil is always administered intravenously, some DDI studies published plasma concentration-time profiles of alfentanil following oral ingestion. The presented alfentanil model was established using clinical PK data of 8 publications, covering iv and oral administration and a dosing range from 0.015 to 0.075 mg/kg as well as absolute doses of 1 mg IV and 4 mg PO. The established model is based on ([Hanke 2018](#5-References)) and applies metabolism by CYP3A4 and glomerular filtration.  

The herein presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of the PBPK model for Alfentanil in (healthy) adults.
