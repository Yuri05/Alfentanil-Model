Alfentanil is a potent analgesic synthetic opioid. It is fast but short-acting and used for anesthesia during surgery. Alfentanil is metabolized solely by CYP3A4 ([Phimmasone 2001](#main-references)). Like midazolam, alfentanil is not a substrate for P-gp ([Wandel 2002](#main-references)) and less than 1% of an alfentanil dose is excreted unchanged in urine ([Meuldermans 1988](#main-references)).

Although in clinical use alfentanil is always administered intravenously (iv), some DDI studies published plasma concentration-time profiles of alfentanil following oral ingestion. The presented alfentanil model was established using clinical PK data of 8 publications, covering iv and oral (po) administration and a dosing range from 0.015 to 0.075 mg/kg as well as absolute doses of 1 mg iv and 4 mg po. The established model is based on the model developed by Hanke *et al.* ([Hanke 2018](#main-references)) and applies metabolism by CYP3A4 and glomerular filtration.
