The PBPK model for alfentanil was developed and evaluated using publically available, clinical pharmacokinetic data from studies listed in [Section 2.2.2](#clinical_data).

The next sections show:

1. the final model parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#final_input_parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#diagnostics_plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#ct_profiles).
